## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned there are multiple ways to build a carousel, you can use arrow buttons as well as navigation dots. There are a few techniques i stumbled across but couldn't implement them well enough in this design. One was getting the measurements of an element in JS even when it is responsive, see below.

This was also the first time using SCSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
getBoundingClientRect()
}
```

### Continued development

I need to be able to create a carousel that also have navigation dots underneath slides. I also need to be to use translate and transition to create a sliding affect when buttons are clicked.
